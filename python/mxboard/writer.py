        Since `asnumpy()` is a blocking function call, this function would block the main
        thread till it returns. It may consequently affect the performance of async execution
        of the MXNet engine.

        Parameters
        ----------
            tag : str
                A tag attached to the summary. Used by TensorBoard for organization.
            labels : MXNet `NDArray` or `numpy.ndarray`.
                The ground truth values. A tensor of 0/1 values with arbitrary shape.
            predictions : MXNet `NDArray` or `numpy.ndarray`.
                A float32 tensor whose values are in the range `[0, 1]`. Dimensions must match
                those of `labels`.
            num_thresholds : int
                Number of thresholds, evenly distributed in `[0, 1]`, to compute PR metrics for.
                Should be `>= 2`. This value should be a constant integer value, not a tensor
                that stores an integer.
                The thresholds for computing the pr curves are calculated in the following way:
                `width = 1.0 / (num_thresholds - 1),
                thresholds = [0.0, 1*width, 2*width, 3*width, ..., 1.0]`.
            global_step : int
                Global step value to record.
            weights : MXNet `NDArray` or `numpy.ndarray`.
                Optional float32 tensor. Individual counts are multiplied by this value.
                This tensor must be either the same shape as or broadcastable to the `labels`
                tensor.

        Parameters
        ----------
            net : Symbol or HybridBlock
                An mxnet.symbol.Symbol or mxnet.gluon.HybridBlock object defining
                the structure of a network. If it's a HybridBlock, users must call hybridize()
                and forward() once before passing to this function.
